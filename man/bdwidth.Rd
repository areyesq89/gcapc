\title{ChIP-seq Binding Width Estimation}
\usage{
bdwidth(cov, range = c(50L, 600L), step = 50L, auto = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cov}{A list object returned by function \code{rc5end}.}

\item{range}{A non-nagative integer vector with length 2. This vector
set the range within which binding width are estimated.
Default c(50,600) represents most ChIP-seq experiments.}

\item{step}{A non-negative integer to set the resolution of binding
width estimation within \code{range}. This value will be tuned if
\code{auto} is TRUE. Default 50 is based on default value of \code{range}.}

\item{auto}{A logical vector which, when TRUE, allows to automatically
tune to higher resolution of binding width estimation. The highest
resolution of 2bp is allowed. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
A numeric indicating estimated binding width.
}
\description{
ChIP-seq experiments usually use crosslinking strategy to capture
sequencing fragments. The fragment size is affected by at least but
not limited to two factors, protein real binding and crosslinking
operation. This function estimate size of binding part in crosslinked
DNA-protein complexes, and denoted that as ChIP-seq binding width.
